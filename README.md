# Insecure Chat Client

A simple insecure chat client

## How to use

```
$ cd insecure-chat-client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This launches the electron client which will try to connect to the server at `ws://localhost:3000`. Make sure that the server is started.
To modify the server connection location, change the config in public/chat.js.
